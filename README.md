🔍 Insights Summary
North America leads in total revenue, while some regions like Middle East show lower satisfaction and higher resolution times.
Long delivery durations are associated with poor satisfaction (under 3 stars), especially for complex orders.
Support issues related to hardware and installation often take longer to resolve and correlate with lower satisfaction.
Orders that are cancelled or have satisfaction ≤ 2 tend to cluster around higher delivery days and longer resolution times.
📌 Recommended Actions
Streamline support processes for technical issues to reduce resolution time.
Prioritize shipping efficiency in underperforming regions.
Investigate root causes behind cancelled orders and low-rated deliveries.
🔭 Next Steps
Integrate forecasting models to predict revenue and satisfaction.
Use clustering or segmentation to target support resources more efficiently.
Build a dynamic dashboard Power BI for real-time KPI monitoring.
